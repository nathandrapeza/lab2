Lab 2:

- 6-7 different files to complete lab
- a proxy has 2 sockets, 1 from your computer, 1 to internet
- proxy acts as both internet and computer
- Client <-> Proxy <-> Google

- multiproxy client almost same as proxy client
- pool is basically an object that contains a collection of processes
- we're trying to have 10 different connections at the same time
- will not work on normal proxy client and normal proxy server
	- line 34 and line 35 of multi proxy cleint.py
		- create 10 different connections, 10 different processes
		- make 10, and have them all use this connect method
		- this is only difference vs proxy client.py

- same multiprocessor approach in MPS as multi echo server

- include all files in question 6 link
